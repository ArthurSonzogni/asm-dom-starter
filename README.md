# asm-dom-starter

A simple web interface written in C++.
This is possible thanks to [asm-dom](https://github.com/mbasso/asm-dom) and 
[gccx](https://github.com/mbasso/gccx) (JSX like syntax for C++).

[Demo page](http://arthursonzogni.github.io/asm-dom-starter/)

This repository is a simple configuration example. I will use this repository
as a starting point for future projects like this.

```bash
npm install
make
```
